# Rabbit MQ

Generally in Message Queue system __Producer(Sender)__ and __Consumer(Reciver)__ are saperate application therefore 
best practice to implement RabbitMq Configuration is to have one __Connection__ per `Process` Or `Application` and one __Channel__ per thread.

> We follow this convention to have one connection per process and one channel per thread.

So in our current implimentation sender and reciver are on same application so we share one connection to both sender and reciver of message queue.
and also we have one channel through of application.

but we can also create two channel one for sender and one for reciver.

> Note: If our sender and receiver have two application then we also create two connection. and each connection have there respective channels depending upon there need. 

## Docker Container Creation

> Run below command to create RabbitMq Docker container

```bash
docker run -d -v rabbitmqv:/var/log/rabbitmq --hostname rmq --name RabbitMqServer -p 5672:5672 -p 8080:15
672 rabbitmq:3.13-management
```
